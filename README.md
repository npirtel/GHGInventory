# GHGInventory
Independent CareerFoundry project tracking the trends, sources, and outputs of global greenhouse gas emissions.

As a part of my final independent project, I created a global greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory using data from Our World in Data, a part of the nonprofit Global Change Data Lab organization based in the UK and The World Bank.

The purpose of this project was to identify the sources, types, and current and future trends of global GHG emissions to manage the risks of increasing emissions associated with climate change and identify reduction strategies to sustain global societies in the long term.

I conducted all analyses including geographic (map) visualizations, supervised (regression analysis) and unsupervised machine learning (cluster analysis), and time series analysis in Python to answer ad hoc project questions. I put together a final presentation in a Tableau storyboard to create a summary of GHG emission sources and types, analyze country characteristic variables associated with GHG emissions, present historical and forecast future emissions and give recommendations for carbon and GHG reduction strategies.

## Technical skills
-> Use of Python for geographic (map) visualizations, supervised (regression analysis) and unsupervised machine learning (cluster analysis), and time series analysis.

-> Tableau to create a storyboard summarizing the GHG inventory.
